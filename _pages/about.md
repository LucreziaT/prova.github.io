I am a PhD student in computer science and remote sensing for Visual Question Answering since October 2022, under the supervision of [Sylvain Lobry, LIPADE](https://www.sylvainlobry.com/), [Flora Weissgerber, ONERA](https://flora.weissgerber.fr/) and [Laurent Wendling,LIPADE](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bsl0MtgAAAAJ&hl=fr).

<p style="text-align: justify"> 
The originality of this project is that we consider the task of automatically answering visual questions from a set of remote sensing images of different modalities and different resolutions. Therefore, it would no longer be nec-essary to choose only the spatial parts of an image that would be relevant for answering the question, but to choose the relevant spatial parts (possibly different for each modality) of different images. This would allow, for instance, to combine the advantages of the spatial accuracy of very high-resolution images, while maintaining the advantages of spatial coverage and acquisition frequency of low-resolution images by combining them with the possibility of still having different information thanks to active sensors.
